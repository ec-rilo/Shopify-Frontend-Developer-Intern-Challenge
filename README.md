## Motivation and Story
This is a project based on the Shopify Front End Developer Intern Challenge [document provided by Shopify](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7mCynsz_cBXkEaCFGSZAuvAOY84QVq35l20xJwjOYg/edit#). The document had a bare minumum of requirements needed but for this project that I chose to go above and beyond with by including a RESTful backend with live questions updates from all users with Socket.io. 

The project wasn't able to be submitted to Shopify in time since I found out about it right after graduation and the deadline was two days after.(graduated 05/20/2022 ðŸ˜Š). But, that didn't stop me from trying!

So over a period of 6 days I was able to plan, mock, create and deploy this fully responsive application to AWS. Showing my skills across the full-stack.

Enjoy! :)

## Features

- **Talk with OpenAI**
  - With a choice of 4 engines, users are able to communicate with AI and be able to get 4 unique responses. Feel free to ask the AI anything!

- **Live user question room**
  - Users that are logged into the application can make questions to the OpenIO API and when they make the question it will be broadcasted to everyone using the application live!
  - This was possible with Socket.io.

- **Custom User Experience**
  - With Firebase Authentication users are able to login to there custom account and be able to make unique posts to the application.

- **Demo App**
  - The same application but NOT linked to a users google account or to others users on the application. The posts you make here to OpenAI are just yours and only viewable on your device.

## Getting Started (locally)

### Step 1. Clone this repo

With SSH
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ec-rilo/fun-with-gpt-3.git
```

With HTTPS
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ec-rilo/fun-with-gpt-3.git
```

### Step 2. Create a PostgreSQL database

Log into postgres with a user of your choice that has permission to create databases (for me it's user `postgres`) and create the database `fun_with_gpt_3`

```bash
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE fun_with_gpt_3
````

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

## Motivation and Story
This is a project based on the Shopify Front End Developer Intern Challenge [document provided by Shopify](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7mCynsz_cBXkEaCFGSZAuvAOY84QVq35l20xJwjOYg/edit#). The document had a bare minumum of requirements needed but for this project I went above and beyond the scope implementing a RESTful back-end along with a Demo version of the app that users can play with locally.

The project wasn't able to be submitted to Shopify in time since I found out about it right after graduation and the deadline was two days after.(graduated 05/20/2022 ðŸ˜Š). But, that didn't stop me from trying!

So over a period of 5 days I was able to plan, mock, create and deploy this fully responsive application to AWS. Showing my skills across the full-stack.

I wanted to showcase my skills and I hope this project shows that!
